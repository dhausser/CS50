1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs, such uit8_t, uint32_t, int32_t and uit16_t
2.  uit8_t, uint32_t, int32_t and uit16_t specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes
4.  The first two bytes of a BMP file should be BM (ASCII), equivalent to 19778 (Decimal) and 4d42 (Hexadecimal)
5.  bfSize is the size of BITMAPFILEHEADER, biSize is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel (bpp).
8.  fopen returns a pointer to the open file. A null pointer value indicates an error. If filename or mode is NULL or an empty string, meaning that the parameter filename is invalid.
9.  The third argument of fread if count, it corresponds to the maximum number of items to be read, in our case we always read items one by one.
10. If bi.biWidth is 3 then copy.c assigns 3 to the padding, since 3 x size of triple is 9, we need 3 more bytes of padding to reach a width of 12 which is multiple of 4.
11. The fseek function moves the file pointer (if any) associated with stream to a new location that is offset bytes from origin.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of file pointer.
