0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary, 
it refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis.

1.  According to its man page, getrusage returns resource usage measures resource usage statistics for either:
- the calling process, its children or a thread
- all children of the calling process that have terminated and been waited for
- resource usage statistics for the calling thread

2.  According to the same man page, a variable of type struct rusage has 16 members:
struct rusage {
               struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
               struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
               long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
               long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */
               long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */
               long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */
               long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
               long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults (hard page faults) */
               long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */
               long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */
               long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */
               long   ru_msgsnd;        /* IPC messages sent */
               long   ru_msgrcv;        /* IPC messages received */
               long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */
               long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */
               long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */
           };

3.  Both before and after are passed by reference so that the the variable themselves are used for tracking usage instead of creating
copies, as would happened if passed by value. So these variables are the same, allowing them to be track over runtime. 

4.  The for loop in main goes reading words from a file by checking each individual charachter using getc untif end of file is 
reached (EOF). 

The first if statement checks whether the char is an alphabetical letter of an apostrophe, if so it appends the character to the 
current word being created at its index, then increments the index in preparation for the next character. If the index exceeds the
maximum size defined by the longest word in the english dictionary, then it consumes the remaining char in the current string and to 
move on to the next word in file.

The second if statement, an else if, takes care of the case when the char being read is a number, and skips to the next word in file.

The last if statetment, an else if as well, identifies whether a word is complete being read from file and calls check to verify if
this word exist in the given dictionary, otherwise increases the count of misspellings and outputs to word to the console. 

5.  Here we need to use getc instead of fscanf to read a full word at time, because of the format of the text being different from
one another, which is not the case with the dictionnary files. Each text file uses different punctuation, which we do not want to 
risk including in our words to be checked. We only want alphabetical charachters and the apostrophe to be recorded as words to be
checks, not any other punctuation they may be read if we were to use fscanf.

6.  The parameters for check and load are declared as const so that the array of char passed as argument is immutable just as
a string would be. In fact a string an immutable array of char. A string or immutable array of char implicitly ends with '\0' 
which allows us to use this feature in our loops for find the end of end word without having to use functions such as strlen, which
may have an impact on performances.
